Ben Everard is a creative technologist working mainly with light and illumination. Here are a few of his past projects.

# Geometric nature experiments

# Islamic art (colaboration with Riaz Shafti)

# Recycling 3D printer waste
3D printers can churn through a lot of plastic. Typically, this is PLA which is not easily recycled using commercial recycling.

Ben has been experimenting with small-scape PLA recycling to create jewelry, clocks and other objects. 3D printer filament is often highly coloured, and when melted, different colours can be swirled together to create marbling effects unachievable by other means.


# PCBs as a creative medium
Printed Circuit Boards are usually rectanglar and locked away behind enclosers so users rarely get to see them. However, they can be manufactured in almost any shape, and in a range of colours. Ben has been experimenting with bare PCBs as Christmas decorations. The highly reflective solder pads can work particularly well with LED illumination.


# LED Clock
This LED word clock was Ben's first foray into using LEDs as a creative medium.

# User interaction
