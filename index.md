Here are some of Ben Everard's past projects



# Geometric nature experiments (2024)
Ben is experimenting with creating medium to large scale light art based around geometric representations of natural forms and proceedurally generated animations based on environmental stimuli.

# Islamic art (colaboration with Riaz Shafti) (2022 - 2023)
Ben colaborated with Islamic artist Riaz Shafti on some pieces of illuminated geometric art.

# Recycling 3D printer waste (2022 -> present)
3D printers can churn through a lot of plastic. Typically, this is PLA which is not easily recycled using commercial recycling.

Ben has been experimenting with small-scape PLA recycling to create jewelry, clocks and other objects. 3D printer filament is often highly coloured, and when melted, different colours can be swirled together to create marbling effects unachievable by other means.

# PCBs as a creative medium (2021 -> 2023)
Printed Circuit Boards are usually rectanglar and locked away behind enclosers so users rarely get to see them. However, they can be manufactured in almost any shape, and in a range of colours. Ben has been experimenting with bare PCBs as Christmas decorations. The highly reflective solder pads can work particularly well with LED illumination.

# Freeform LED circuits (2021)
Typically, circuits are made on PCB or breadboard. However, anything that carries current can be used. Ben experimented with attaching addressable LEDs to brass frames to create circuits.

# LED Clock (2019)
This LED word clock was Ben's first foray into using LEDs as a creative medium.

**This clock has been happily running for five years**

# User interaction (2021 - 2022)
We interact with computers in a very limited number of ways. Typically, keyboard, mouse and gamepad. However, there are many more sensors that can be used to take input from a user. Ben experimented by building a series of alternative computer controllers.
