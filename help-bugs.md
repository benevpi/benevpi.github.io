Insect populations are in trouble, but there are things we can do to help.

At a personal level, if you have some outdoor space (such as a garden), you can add some bug-friendly features. The RHS has some excellent advice here:

* https://www.rhs.org.uk/prevention-protection/controlling-pests-and-diseases-without-chemicals

It's also important that we act at a national level. Campaign groups such as BugLife(https://www.buglife.org.uk/) are helping to make the future more insect friendly.
